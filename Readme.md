# 🐑 D’ezabin Abba

**D’ezabin Abba** is a quirky merge-and-evolve idle game inspired by the classic Passover song *Chad Gadya*. This project was developed as part of the **Gameplay Lab course at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design**.

You start with a baby lamb, merge animals to evolve them into stronger forms, and survive escalating attacks from the **Angel of Death** and his destructive arsenal.

## 🧠 Game Concept

The gameplay fuses:
- Merge mechanics (inspired by *Cow Evolution*, *2048*)
- Idle progression and creature upgrades
- Real-time attacks from smart AI enemies
- A humorous and surreal reinterpretation of the *Chad Gadya* chain of destruction

Players must strategically manage their creatures while avoiding timed attacks from the Angel of Death and his minions. Can you survive long enough to evolve past the final form?

## 👨‍💻 My Role

As part of the development team, I was responsible for:

- Implementing the full **UI system**, including HUD, menus, tooltips, and scene transitions
- Connecting UI elements (e.g., buttons, HUD actions) directly to **gameplay logic**, such as:
  - Spawning creatures via interactive buttons
  - Activating power-ups and special effects
- Integrating **sound effects** using the custom audio engine built by Liel
- Managing the **Git repository** and coordinating task assignments within the dev team
- Assisting with polish and final bug-fixing during integration and submission

This project gave me the opportunity to lead the design and implementation of user-facing systems, and to bridge the gap between visual interface and game mechanics.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Unity 6 (URP)

- Object Pooling (enemies, audio)
- Custom UI architecture and tooltip system
- Modular sound system

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Merge bug:** Rapid merge inputs may cause queued creatures to appear incorrectly. Considering a cooldown.
- **Difficulty curve:** Some mid-late game balance tweaks are still in progress.
